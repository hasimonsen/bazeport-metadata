**Last updated:** September 17, 2025

## Data Collection and Usage
- This extension does **not** collect, sell, or transmit personally identifiable information.  
- Any metadata parsed (e.g., filenames, series/episode details) is processed **locally in your browser**.  
- Local extension storage (`chrome.storage`) is used only to save **settings and preferences**.  
- If TMDb integration is enabled, queries are sent to [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/)â€™s public API **solely to fetch metadata**. These requests are anonymous.

## User Consent
By installing and using this extension, you consent to the limited use of data described above.  
No hidden data collection or background tracking is performed.

## Third-Party Services
- The extension may communicate with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to retrieve movie/TV information.  
- Data sent in these requests is limited to **show names, years, or episode identifiers**.  
- No personal user information is transmitted.

---

## Data Storage
- All user preferences and extension settings are stored **locally on your device** using Chromeâ€™s extension storage system.  
- No external storage is used.

## Changes

Updates will always be reflected here with a new **"last updated"** date.
